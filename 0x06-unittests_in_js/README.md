# 0x06. Unittests in JS

This project focuses on mastering unit and integration testing in JavaScript, specifically using the Mocha test framework. Through this project, you'll learn how to write robust tests to ensure your code functions as expected. The key areas covered include using assertion libraries, handling asynchronous functions, and writing integration tests.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn:

- **Mocha Test Suite:** How to use Mocha to write and structure your test suites.
- **Assertion Libraries:** How to use different assertion libraries like Node's built-in assert module or Chai for more expressive assertions.
- **Presenting Long Test Suites:** Techniques for organizing and presenting lengthy test suites efficiently.
- **Spies and Stubs:** When and how to use spies to observe function behavior and stubs to simulate different scenarios in your tests.
- **Hooks:** What hooks are, and how to use them in your test suites to manage setup and teardown tasks.
- **Async Function Testing:** How to unit test functions that involve asynchronous operations.
- **Integration Tests:** How to write integration tests with a small Node.js server, testing the interaction between various components of your application.
